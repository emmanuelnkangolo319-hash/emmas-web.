    <h1>My Birthday Wish-List</h1>
    <h2>Hey Dad! As my birthday’s coming up, I wanted to share a few things I’ve been really excited about and explain why they’d help me grow, learn, and work on new projects. I’ve put a lot of thought into each item, especially how I’d use it responsibly and take good care of it.</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="b1">
            <h3>A 3D Printer</h3>
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=3d+printer&crid=30LTOHTYT1QNN&sprefix=3d+printer+%2Caps%2C183&ref=nb_sb_noss_2">
                <img class="i1" src="AI 3D Printer.jpeg"></a>
            <p>I’ve been really interested in learning 3D design and creating things at home.
        A <b>3D Printer</b> would help me build new skills and work on cool school projects.
        I’ve been researching how to use one safely and responsibly.
        I’d take great care of it and use it for learning, not just fun.
        If you’re open to it, could we look at some options together?</p></div>
        <div class="b2"><h3>An Arduino Kit</h3>
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=arduino+kit&crid=25SSK211A18JX&sprefix=arduino+kit%2Caps%2C240&ref=nb_sb_noss_1">
                <img src="Know all about Arduino !.jpeg"></a>
            <p>Also, I’ve been getting really interested in electronics and coding lately.
        An <b>Arduino Kit</b> would help me understand circuits and programming better.
        I’ve been learning how to use one safely and for real projects.
        I’d take good care of it and use it responsibly.</p></div>
        <div class="b3"><h3>Headphones</h3>
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=headphones&crid=1O83NNJJPCU77&sprefix=head%2Caps%2C203&ref=nb_sb_ss_p13n-expert-pd-ops-ranker_ci_tech-br-left_1_4">
                <img src="reading 🙆_♀️.jpeg"></a>
            <p>Also, I’ve been needing a good pair of <b>headphones</b> for schoolwork and focusing.
        They would help me with online assignments, videos, and studying without distractions.
        I’d make sure to take good care of them and use them responsibly.
        I’ve looked into different types so I know what would last and work well.</p></div>
        <div class="b4"><h3>A Bible</h3>
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=bible&crid=ZR0UH986SU03&sprefix=bible%2Caps%2C197&ref=nb_sb_noss_1">
                <img src="Biblia abierta con icono de crucifijo detrás _ Foto Premium.jpeg"></a>
            <p>Also, I’ve been needing a good <b>Bible</b> for schoolwork and personal study.
                 It would help me with assignments, reading, and
                  understanding scripture without distractions. I’d make sure to take
                   good care of it and use it responsibly. I’ve looked into different
                    editions, so I know which one would last and be most helpful for my needs.</p></a></div></div>
    <h4>Thanks for listening to everything I’ve been asking about, Dad.
        I really appreciate you taking the time to hear me out.
        Whenever you’re free, we can talk about which ones I could get or look at together.
        I’m excited to learn and use whatever you think is best. Thank you for even looking at this, love youuu!!!</h4>
